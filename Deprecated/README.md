# Deprecated Breakout Board Designs

This folder contains older breakout board designs for various RF modules that are no longer actively maintained or supported. These designs have been moved from the main repository to this subfolder for archival purposes. While they can still be used, please note that they may not meet modern standards or compatibility requirements.

For current and actively supported designs, please refer to the main repository [here](../README.md).

## Deprecated Modules

### 1. **RFM12**
   - **Frequency Bands**: 433 MHz, 868 MHz, 915 MHz.
   - **Features**: A popular low-power FSK transceiver module used for sub-GHz communication.
   - **Applications**: Suitable for wireless sensor networks, home automation, and low-power telemetry.

### 2. **RFM26W**
   - **Frequency Bands**: Sub-GHz frequencies.
   - **Features**: Long-range wireless communication with low power consumption.
   - **Applications**: Ideal for IoT applications and long-range sensor networks.

### 3. **RFM69W**
   - **Frequency Bands**: 315 MHz, 433 MHz, 868 MHz, 915 MHz.
   - **Features**: A versatile low-power transceiver module capable of FSK, GFSK, and OOK modulation.
   - **Applications**: Widely used for wireless networks, industrial control, and telemetry.

### 4. **RFM9xW**
   - **Frequency Bands**: 868 MHz, 915 MHz.
   - **Features**: LoRa-based long-range communication with enhanced penetration through obstacles.
   - **Applications**: Best suited for long-range wireless sensor networks, IoT applications, and remote monitoring.

## Important Notes

- **No Active Support**: These designs are no longer actively maintained or updated. Use at your own discretion, and note that modern alternatives with improved performance are available in the main repository.
- **Compatibility Issues**: These designs may not be compatible with newer systems or microcontrollers without modification. Users are encouraged to transition to more current designs if possible.

For the latest breakout boards supporting modern LoRa modules such as the RFM95/RFM96 series, please check the main project [here](../README.md).
